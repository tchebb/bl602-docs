Quick Start Guide
=================

Prerequisites
-------------

-  A BL602 development board such as:

  - `PineCone <https://www.pine64.org/2020/10/28/nutcracker-challenge-blob-free-wifi-ble/>`__
  - `Doi.am DT-BL10 <https://www.cnx-software.com/2020/10/25/bl602-iot-sdk-and-5-dt-bl10-wifi-ble-risc-v-development-board/>`__, or
  - a first-party `BL602 EVB <https://twitter.com/SipeedIO/status/1321288991442980866>`__ (These were apparently available by way of an early-adopter program.)

-  A PC (running Windows or Linux; macOS may work - please `contribute documentation <https://github.com/pine64/bl602-docs>`__ if so!)

Preparing the environment
-------------------------

To get started, follow the instructions for your preferred development host platform:

-  `Linux <Linux/Quickstart_Linux_ubuntu.html>`__ (Ubuntu LTS is used, but any relatively modern version and distribution should work.)
-  `Windows <Windows/Quickstart_Windows_msys.html>`__ using MSYS (Windows 7 or newer is recommended.)
-  Windows with `WSL <Windows/Quickstart_Windows_wsl.html>`__ (Windows 10 is required.)
-  `macOS <Mac/Quickstart_macOS.html>`__ (Xcode Tools are required; Homebrew is optional, but recommended.)
