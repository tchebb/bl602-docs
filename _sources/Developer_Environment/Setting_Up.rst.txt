Developer Environment
=====================

This directory explains the usage of tools such as the compiler, downloader and debugger.

Compiler
--------

The compiler is available in Linux or Windows. See `Compiling under Linux <../Quickstart_Guide/Linux/Quickstart_Linux_ubuntu.html>`__ and `Compiling under Windows <../Quickstart_Guide/Windows/Quickstart_Windows_msys.html>`__.

Flasher
-------
For now, it's recommended that you use BouffaloLab's proprietary tool ``BLFlashEnv`` to flash your software to the target module. For specific usage, refer to the `BLFlashEnv <BLFlashEnv/BLFlashEnv.html>`__ documentation.

A couple of open-source flash tools are also available; see the `BouffaloLab BLOpenFlasher <https://github.com/bouffalolab/BLOpenFlasher>`__ and `stschake's bl60x-flash <https://github.com/stschake/bl60x-flash>`__ projects on GitHub for more information.

Debugger
--------

Choose one of the two methods of ``Eclipse + OpenOCD`` or ``Freedom Studio + OpenOCD`` for debugging. Refer to `Eclipse <eclipse/eclipse.html>`__ and `Freedom Studio <freedom_studio/freedom_studio.html>`__ for specifics.
